# VGMIDI Dataset

VGMIDI is a dataset of piano arrangements of video game soundtracks. It contains 200 MIDI pieces labelled according to emotion and 3,850 unlabeled pieces. Each labelled piece was annotated by 30 human subjects according to the Circumplex (valence-arousal) model of emotion. 

## Data Annotation

We designed a custom web tool to annotate the video game soundtracks in MIDI format. The source code for this tool
can be found [here](https://github.com/lucasnfe/adl-music-annotation) and the details on the annotation process can be found in [this paper](http://www.lucasnferreira.com/papers/2019/ismir-learning.pdf).
